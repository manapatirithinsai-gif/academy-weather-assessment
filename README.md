# Coding-Assesment
Introduction
This repository contains my solution for the RDK Academy Coding Assessment.
The assessment includes two activities:
Activity 1: Weather Application using OpenWeather API
Activity 2: Converting pseudocode into a working program to find the median of numbers
The project is implemented using Python and follows the requirements provided in the assessment document.

Activity 1 – Weather Application
Description
This is a command-line weather application that allows users to search for weather information of a city using the OpenWeather API.
It also allows users to maintain a list of favourite cities in memory.

Implementation Details
The application uses the requests library to call the OpenWeather API.
Favourite cities are stored in memory only, as required.
Proper input validation and error handling are implemented to avoid crashes.

How to Run
python weather_app.py

Activity 2 – Median of an Array
Description
This activity converts the provided pseudocode into a working Python program.
The program sorts an array of numbers and finds the median.
Implementation Details
A bubble sort algorithm is implemented manually (no built-in sort used).
The median is calculated based on:
Odd number of elements → middle value
Even number of elements → average of two middle values
User inputs numbers through the command line.

How to Run
python activity2_median.py

Testing
Both activities were tested manually using different scenarios

Conclusion
This project demonstrates:
API integration
Command-line application development
Algorithm implementation
Clean and readable code structure
